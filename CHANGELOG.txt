0.7.0

a big release with lots of changes to low-level machinery.

user-facing:

* added a new "crossfade" playback mode that can be used instead of "gapless". 
  users can change this functionality in the settings view.
* fixed audio artifacts in WasapiOut and DirectSoundOut when pausing and 
  resuming playback multiple times very quickly.
* fixed a really bad bug where dialogs could not be easily dismissed in some
  cases. this included the first-run dialog! yikes.

low-level:

* added Latency() and Drain() methods to the IOutput interface
* reduced CPU load in some output plugins by being less aggressive about keeping
  the output buffers 100% full all the time. 75%+ fill rate should be
  sufficient.
* generalized MessageQueue and moved it out of app, and into core so it can be
  reused for other functionality (e.g. crossfading)
* added support for "mix points" in Player -- get a callback as soon as a 
  specific playback position is hit!
* fixed DirectSoundOut to fall back to software mixing if hardware mixing is
  unavailable
* fixed DirectSoundOut to start playback immediately, instead of sometimes 
  requiring the buffer to be completely full

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.6.2

* added a DirectSound output plugin for the win32 build.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.6.1

* replaced mpg123 decoder with MAD. gapless playback for a much wider variety of
  mp3s!
* optimized indexing process by maintaining an in-memory database id cache. uses
  a bit more memory (temporarily, during indexing) but improves indexing speed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.6.0

* added the ability to have multiple output plugins, and the ability switch
  between them in settings
* added a new default output plugin for win32 (WASAPI) and linux (PulseAudio)
* changed a bunch of low-level ui code to substantially reduce layout passes and
  redraws
* made a few small changes to the main ui, including basic listview headers if
  the window grows large enough

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.5.0

user-facing:

* remember volume and repeat settings across app launches
* improved visualizer quality
* reduced download size by a couple megabytes

low-level:

* optimized Stream and Player communication. more direct, less locking. no more 
  weird deferred cleanup
* removed fftw3 dependency in favor of kiss_fft. much smaller download now
* added a proper windowing algorithm to audio samples before they are handed to 
  the fft process
* fixed audio de-interleaving issue which lead to funky fft results in some 
  cases
* included a new spectrum visualizer sample called GdiVis (win32 only for now)
* overhauled some parts of the audio engine to ensure buffer size is consistent
  during playback. this makes visualization quality better, and should make it
  easier to integrate with things like JACK and PulseAudio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.4.1

* fixed the transport readout to be more legible
* fixed a crash in NowPlayingLayout when the window became too small
* improved the IPlaybackService and IPlaybackRemote interfaces, and introduced a
  new IRetainedTrack type.
* upgraded build environment to visual studio 2017

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.4.0

* updated transport focus behavior to be less confusing -- it was previously too
  easy to accidentally focus the transport.
* added mute functionality. focus the volume control and press enter or just
  press m while browsing your library.
* added new IPlaybackRemote and IPlaybackService sdk interfaces to support 
  writing plugins that can control playback and be notified of playback events.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.3.5

* various small visualizer-related fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.3.4

* visualizer support! press v to show the picker! a couple samples (Milkdrop2 
  and projectM) are included below. unzip these to your musikbox\plugins 
  directory.
* fixed a nasty unicode conversion bug.
* various other small fixes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.2.2

* small improvements to the transport view, including the display of the volume 
  percentage next to the volume slider.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.2.1

* initial "public" release
