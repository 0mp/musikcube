# musikcube-websockets
a playback remote for musikcube using web sockets. 

musikcube for windows, macOS, and linux are supported. an android client is included as well.

this is currently a hack-and-slash proof-of-concept. the code is ugly, but it works pretty well. i currently have it running 24/7 on a raspberry pi with an [iqaudio dac+](http://iqaudio.co.uk/audio/8-pi-dac-0712411999643.html), paired with a first generation moto g as a remote. 

the backend plugin uses [websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp). the android client uses [nv-websocket-client](https://github.com/TakahikoKawasaki/nv-websocket-client).
